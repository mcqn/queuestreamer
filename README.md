*get_radio.rb* is a simple script to find radio shows in the last ten days to download, and then downloads them using `get_iplayer`.

*play_radio* is another small script, which finds all the mp3s in the given directory and plays them in age order with `mplayer`.  Once the mp3 has been played the script will delete it and move onto the next one.
